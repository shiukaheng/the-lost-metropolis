WIP!

Posts have a owner, lists of viewers and editors, and a public bool. These determine the permissions to edit and view the post.
Posts have an attached assets list, which is a list of assets attached to the post.

[] = Client side logic
<> = Server side logic

Post -> Add asset -> [Create initial asset object] -> [upload asset to folder with post id as name] -> 
<Find corresponding asset object and update asset data with file contents>
