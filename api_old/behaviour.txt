WIP!

Posts have a owner, lists of viewers and editors, and a public bool. These determine the permissions to edit and view the post.
Posts have an attached assets list, which is a list of assets attached to the post.

[] = Client side logic
<> = Server side logic

Post -> Add asset -> [Create initial asset object] -> [upload asset to folder with post id as name] -> <Checking whether user has permissions to upload by checking post document> -> 
<Cloud function trigger: Find corresponding asset object and update asset data with file contents> -> [UI listens for changes]

User deletes post -> <Cloud function trigger: Delete assets folder> -> [UI listens for changes]

No need for URL resolution for assets, baseUrl will always be static.thelostmetropolis.org/<post id>/<asset id>
